00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.008
- Many organizations are excited

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.000
about the ways artificial intelligence

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.008
can take their business to the next level.

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.003
But they might not have a very clear sense

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.005
of which AI tools will help them get there.

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.002
Well-designed AI systems can help you

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:20.002
better interact with your customers or identify new markets.

8
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.005
These systems can predict your inventory

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.009
and make real-time decisions.

10
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.005
There's a huge amount of potential with this technology,

11
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.004
but with so many possibilities,

12
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.006
it can be hard to see the best place to start.

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.003
Hi, I'm Doug Rose, and this course takes a look

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.003
at popular tools and concepts

15
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.008
in artificial intelligence systems.

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.009
We'll start by exploring some high-level concepts,

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.003
such as machine learning, artificial neural networks,

18
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.008
deep learning, and natural language processing.

19
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.007
Then we'll look at the tools you'll need

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.004
to build these systems.

21
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.009
Some of these might come from software vendors,

22
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.003
while others might be open source tools

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.001
that allow you to build your own systems.

24
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.006
Whether you're an executive, director, project manager,

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.004
product manager, or software developer,

26
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.003
this course will help you benefit

27
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.005
from this powerful technology.

28
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.000
Your first AI products might determine

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.004
the entire course of your business,

30
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.007
so let's start figuring out what you need to know

31
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:24.007
to build or buy the best AI systems for your organization.
