00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.000
- Natural language generation

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.003
is a sophisticated way for artificial intelligence

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.003
to generate very natural-sounding text.

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.001
Now, I have a little bit of a confession to make.

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.007
I actually didn't write that first sentence.

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.006
It was written for me with the help

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:20.008
of a natural language generation, or NLG, application.

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.000
And while these applications can produce text

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.002
similar to what a human might write,

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:30.000
the process of writing is very different for an AI system.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.009
The system doesn't write in the same way

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.000
that you might've learned in a Creative Writing course.

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.004
The computer sees writing as a data challenge,

14
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.003
and not a creative process.

15
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.006
An AI system looks for patterns in the data.

16
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.004
So in this case, the system finds the most common phrases

17
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.004
that match up to keywords.

18
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.007
For this sentence,

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.008
the AI system looked through millions of webpages

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.006
and matched words "natural language generation".

21
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.002
You can almost think of NLG

22
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.006
as a super-powered search engine.

23
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.002
The AI system searched for a phrase,

24
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.000
and then it searched deeper within those results.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then it takes all that information

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.001
and reassembles it to closely match the text patterns

27
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.009
it came up with in the search results.

28
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.000
Afterwards, it goes through to make sure

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.009
that it's not an exact copy of the text and the results.

30
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.008
Now, the system just generated this one sentence,

31
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.000
but most people use this technology

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.006
to generate paragraphs, and even articles.

33
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.002
Right now, NLG works best for product reviews,

34
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.007
weather forecasts, and even news stories.

35
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.009
Natural language generation does especially well

36
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.004
when you have to combine data from different sources

37
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.005
and then present it to a wider audience.

38
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.002
The Associated Press uses NLG

39
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:55.001
to publish articles about a company's quarterly earnings.

40
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.005
These are short summaries

41
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.005
that come out about four times a year

42
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.007
to report how companies are performing

43
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.007
with their share price.

44
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:04.009
NLG works well here because you have data

45
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.008
from several different sources.

46
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.001
The NLG system combines these data sources

47
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.000
and adds some text to write a story.

48
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.003
That means that you'll get a quarterly earnings report

49
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.002
that sounds a lot like this.

50
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.004
"Microsoft had its third-quarter earnings report today,

51
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:25.006
and its stock price went up 5% in after-hours trading.

52
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:28.004
That's up 1% from last quarter,

53
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.004
and met forecasters' expectations.

54
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.008
The company said it was not affected

55
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.005
by supply chain issues with China."

56
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.008
So here you're combining the share price,

57
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.005
the expected share price,

58
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.000
and then how the shares were priced last quarter.

59
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.008
Then you'd combine that with relevant news.

60
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:49.006
Finally, you glue it together

61
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.008
with some appropriate words and transitions.

62
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.007
You've probably read several short stories written this way,

63
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.001
and not even realized that it was generated

64
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.006
in milliseconds by an AI system.

65
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.004
If you're thinking about using this technology

66
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:05.000
for your organization,

67
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
a good first step is to consider

68
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.008
the different data sources that you'd like to combine.

69
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.008
Maybe you'll create automated executive briefings,

70
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:16.004
or even short news stories.

71
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.009
Or as you'll see later, you can even use it

72
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.006
to better communicate with your customer.
