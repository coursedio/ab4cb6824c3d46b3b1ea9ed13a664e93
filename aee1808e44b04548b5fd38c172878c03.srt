00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.008
- One of the most interesting areas

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.004
in artificial intelligence

3
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:07.004
is natural language processing, or NLP.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.007
NLP allows artificial intelligence systems

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.006
to both read and write using natural language.

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.001
The system can read

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.008
using natural language understanding, or NLU.

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.002
Then the system writes

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.003
using natural language generation, or NLG.

10
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:27.009
Natural language processing

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.004
can also involve speech recognition,

12
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.008
which is when a machine identifies spoken words

13
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.001
and converts them to text.

14
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.009
But NLP doesn't need speech recognition.

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.006
A lot of it is just about reading and writing text.

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.001
So think of it this way.

17
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.005
If you pick up your smartphone

18
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.009
and ask the virtual assistant a question,

19
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.009
it will actually break that down into several steps.

20
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.003
Say you ask, "What's the weather today?"

21
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:57.003
The first step is for the smartphone to take your audio file

22
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.004
and upload it to a speech recognition system.

23
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.008
The next step is then to convert that audio into text.

24
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.009
Once your smartphone has the text,

25
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.008
the last step is to use natural language understanding

26
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.003
to convert it into something

27
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.009
that a search engine might understand.

28
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.008
So it could pull out key words such as "weather",

29
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:22.000
and translate "today" into "current conditions".

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
After it's gone through this NLU process,

31
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.006
then it will use natural language generation.

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.005
This will output the results using friendly text,

33
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.006
instead of a chart or report.

34
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:34.005
So instead of just having

35
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.003
a picture with the current weather,

36
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.009
your smartphone might respond,

37
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.008
"It will be sunny and 73 today."

38
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.006
So to you, it might seem like a simple process.

39
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.004
You ask a question about the weather,

40
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.007
and you get an appropriate response.

41
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.003
But to the AI system, the natural language processing

42
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.004
has undergone all three steps.

43
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.006
Now, because there are so many smartphones,

44
00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:00.001
speech recognition has become extremely popular.

45
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:05.005
But organizations often use NLP for email and online chats.

46
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.003
For example,

47
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.002
AI systems could use natural language understanding

48
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.002
to read incoming messages.

49
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.002
So that means, if a customer sent an email

50
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.005
to your organization,

51
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.008
it could automatically be routed to the correct person.

52
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:21.002
Then organizations could use natural language generation

53
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.006
to send out an appropriate response.

54
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.004
Maybe the customer will instantly be notified

55
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.003
that your organization understands their challenges.

56
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.007
Then their issue will be routed to the correct person.

57
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.005
You could also use natural language generation systems

58
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:39.008
to explain complex reports, or even create news articles.

59
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.003
So even though it might seem like speech recognition

60
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.002
presents some of the greatest challenges,

61
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:48.006
it's actually natural language understanding and generation

62
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.006
that could be much more difficult.

63
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:54.002
It's processing much more complex information.

64
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.002
Language is filled with structural inconsistencies,

65
00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:00.002
and many people exaggerate or use metaphors.

66
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.006
It's very difficult for an AI system

67
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:03.007
to understand what you mean

68
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:06.004
when you say you've been waiting forever,

69
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:09.003
or that you're deeply disappointed.

70
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:10.005
And you wouldn't want the system

71
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.007
to send back a message that says something like,

72
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:14.007
"I'm glad you're enjoying your product.

73
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:18.004
Our support team will get back to you as soon as possible."

74
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:20.001
Not only does the AI system need

75
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.005
to figure out what you mean,

76
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:24.006
the system has to come up with an appropriate response.

77
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.004
That's the best way to ensure

78
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:29.000
a positive experience for your customers.
